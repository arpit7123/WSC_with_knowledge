{"sentence": "Race drivers don't give up until well after all hope is lost. If the car is accelerating and you believe you're pressing on the brake, release the pedal you're pushing, move your foot to the left and try again. ... In manual transmission-equipped cars, press the clutch at the first hint of unintended acceleration."}
