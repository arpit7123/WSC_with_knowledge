{"sentence": "The streetlight effect, or the drunkard's search principle, is a type of observational  bias that occurs when people only search for something where it is easiest to  look. Both names refer to a well-known joke: A policeman sees a drunk man  searching for something under a streetlight and asks what the drunk has lost."}
