{"sentence": "Locate your water meter and check the leak indicator to see if it is moving. ... If the dial is moving, chances are, you have a leak. Or, you can also take a meter reading and wait 1 or 2 hours and take another meter reading (make sure no water is used during this time). If the reading has changed, you have a leak."}
