{"sentence": "If the patch does fall off, what you need to do depends on how long it has been off, and how many days the patch was on before it came off. If it's been off for less than 48 hours: ... if it's not sticky, put a new patch on (don't try to hold the old patch in place with a plaster or bandage)"}
