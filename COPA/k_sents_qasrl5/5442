{"sentence": "Subtraction is an arithmetic operation that represents the operation of removing  objects from a collection. The result of a subtraction is called a difference.  Subtraction is signified by the minus sign (−). For example, in the adjacent picture , there are 5 − 2 apples—meaning 5 apples with 2 taken away, which is a total of  3 apples."}
